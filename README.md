# Issue

When using a custom arg to match input based on my own values, logging the error produces the following output.

This has been generatd from `Test.ts:18`

```
ResultError: Unwrap failed
    at Err.unwrap (\sapphire-unwrap-error\node_modules\@sapphire\result\src\lib\Result\Err.ts:108:2)
    at Args.pick (\sapphire-unwrap-error\node_modules\@sapphire\framework\dist\lib\parsers\Args.js:45:19)
    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)
    at PingCommand.messageRun (\sapphire-unwrap-error\src\commands\Test.ts:15:34)
    at async \sapphire-unwrap-error\node_modules\@sapphire\framework\dist\optional-listeners\message-command-listeners\CoreMessageCommandAccepted.js:20:23
    at Object.fromAsync (\sapphire-unwrap-error\node_modules\@sapphire\result\src\lib\Result.ts:55:2)
```

In this case, I want to handle the following cases, and return 1 of 3 messages.

-   Arg Provided, matched
-   Arg Provided, unmatched
-   No Arg Provided

I know that I could peekResult or similar and decide whether to reply with the _unmatched message_ or _no arg message_ -
But eventually I will want to expand the `ThingArg` out to throw errors of other types.

# Reproduction Steps

1. Run `npm install`
2. Provide token in Bot.ts
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Run commands with input below

## Expected Results

### Thing provided, correctly found match in `ThingArg`

In this case, the input provided is matched using the `ThingArg`.

`^test apple`

> **Apple:** Juicy and Sweet

### Thing provided, but was not matched inside `ThingArg`

In this case, we provide input that cannot be matched by the arg. `test bus`

> 'Bus' was not recognized as a valid Thing.

### No arg provided at all

In this case, no input is provided, but a different message is displayed.

> All Things: Apple, Pineapple, Pen
